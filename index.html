    <h2>Hello.</h2>
    <p class="intro">I am a process engineer working with people and equipment turning components into sellable products. I try to take
      decisions based on data. Data shows me who is good and who is learning. Data leads me to the areas that need improving.
      Professionally I deal with operational excellence and engineering for a multinational manufacturing organization.
      Working with people coming from varying countries and environments, with differing viewpoints, cultures and understanding
      of the world is something that really agrees with me.

      <h3>Python and data science</h3>
      <p>The data analysis has always been of professional interest to me. So I am deeply involved into changing of
        available data into actionable insights. It takes some time and skills in order to change data from well being data
        into something you can take action from.
        I am working with SAP, Excel - creating dashboards, Python and R.

      <h3>Manufacturing</h3>
      <p>Making real, tangible products, working in between industrial data and the real people and machines is fantastic!
      so is being able to influence the culture, to change ways of working resulting in improvements for people, processes and
      productivity. I am blessed to be one of these individuals that really enjoy what they are doing. </p>
